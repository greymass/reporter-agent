### Unicove - Multisig Account Management

Added comprehensive multisig support enabling users to manage accounts controlled by multiple people. Teams can now view permission structures, create proposals requiring group approval, and track authorization progress directly through the interface. This makes group account management accessible without command-line tools.

The multisig interface displays permission hierarchies clearly and handles scheduled proposals for team decision-making. Users can see who has authority to approve actions, create proposals for group decisions, and monitor approval status. This protects shared resources by requiring multiple approvals before executing transactions.

### Unicove - Cross-Network Support

Improved how Unicove works across different Antelope blockchains. The updated design allows Unicove to adapt automatically to different network capabilities. This makes it easier to support new blockchains and ensures features work appropriately based on what each network provides.

Integrated smart contract-based data access created in January, reducing reliance on traditional data sources while preparing for an upcoming rebrand. Added gifted RAM feature allowing users to purchase RAM for other accounts, making resource management more helpful for onboarding new users.

Released 33 updates throughout February with frequent improvements following major feature additions. Enhanced visual indicators to distinguish smart contract accounts from regular accounts. Improved transaction feedback with clearer success and error messages. Fixed social media link previews to display properly when sharing account pages.

### Mobile Wallets

Fixed twelve issues affecting mobile wallet reliability and performance. Resolved problems with startup timing that caused errors. Improved responsiveness when switching between screens. Fixed compatibility issues affecting older Android device versions.

Added streamlined account creation connecting to centralized account setup service. This provides consistent account creation experience across all Greymass products. Updated account lookup to use modernized service launched in January for faster search results.

### Web Authenticator

Completed deployment to global edge network enabling faster access worldwide. Users connecting from different regions experience quicker loading and better responsiveness regardless of location. The no-download wallet now responds faster while keeping security keys under user control.

This completes the transition begun in January, moving from single-location hosting to distributed edge deployment for better worldwide performance.

### Developer Tools

Updated system contract definitions to match current implementations. Fixed compilation issues to improve development experience. Added support for temporary accounts in wallet integration tools enabling better testing workflows.

### Summary

Merged 52 updates across 7 repositories in February. Work focused on making multisig account management accessible through Unicove, improving cross-network flexibility, and completing global deployment of Web Authenticator. These improvements enable teams to manage shared resources more easily and provide faster experiences for users worldwide.
